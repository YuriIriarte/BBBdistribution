The bimodal beta-binomial (BBB) ​​distribution corresponds to a weighted version of the beta-binomial (BB) distribution, which admits up to two modes for the probability mass function. Like the BB distribution, the BBB distribution performs well in modeling overdispersed binomial data, and can even outperform the BB distribution when the data exhibit bimodality.
This website provides R programming language codes for computing the probability mass function, cumulative distribution function, rth moment, coefficient of variation, and coefficient of skewness of the BBB distribution. Additionally, an R code for computing the maximum likelihood estimators using the optim function is provided.
